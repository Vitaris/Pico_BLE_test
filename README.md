# Pico BLE Multi-Device Test

This is a test repository for exploring Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity with multiple devices on the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040). The main goal is to experiment with:

- Managing multiple simultaneous BLE connections
- Understanding connection handling and stability
- Testing device discovery and pairing processes
- Implementing reliable data transfer between multiple devices

## Features
- LCD displays for connection status and debugging
- Button inputs for testing different connection scenarios
- LED indicators for connection states

## Current Status
This is an experimental repository for testing and learning BLE capabilities of the Pico, focusing on multi-device connectivity scenarios.
